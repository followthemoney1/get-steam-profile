# get-steam-profile
A simple app witch help you to understand how we can easily get steam user profile data using api &amp; kotlin. If you had anything that you can change on this repository feel free to create a merge request 😁
For the first, this app starts as startup to find new friends to play, simular to PLINK.app

# With this exaple you may do:
 - stats: you can grab steam profile data
 - stats: whitch game you play last 2 weeks
 - stats: what rank you had
 - stats: add new one rank you write from yourself

# Will be perfect
